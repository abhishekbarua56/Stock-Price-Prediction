# Stock Price Prediction Using ARIMA

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. It aims to analyze historical stock data to forecast future prices, providing valuable insights for investors and analysts.

## Motivation
Accurate stock price predictions are essential for making informed investment decisions. By utilizing historical data, this project seeks to enhance forecasting accuracy and help understand market trends.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Yahoo Finance
- **Stock**: Google
- **Time Period**: [Specify the time period, e.g., 2015-2023]
- **Key Features**:
  - Date
  - Open
  - High
  - Low
  - Close
  - Volume

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset was collected from Yahoo Finance.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, and transformed data as needed.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted analyses to uncover trends and patterns in stock prices.
4. **Modeling**: Implemented the ARIMA model for time series forecasting.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical calculations
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `statsmodels` for ARIMA implementation

## Results
The ARIMA model effectively predicted stock prices, demonstrating a good fit for the historical data. Visualizations comparing actual vs. predicted prices illustrate the model's accuracy and performance.

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhishekbarua56/Stock-Price-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `Complete_Stock_Price_Predictor.ipynb`.

## Future Work
- Experiment with alternative forecasting models such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks or Prophet for improved accuracy.
- Expand the dataset to include additional features, like macroeconomic indicators or sentiment analysis.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of ARIMA for stock price prediction, providing insights into historical trends and forecasting future prices. The results highlight the potential of time series analysis in financial decision-making.
